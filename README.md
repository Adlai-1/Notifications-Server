# About
* This Server was created for delivering push notifications to users of mobile applications developed with React-Native Expo ( specifically IOS users ).

# Reasons for this Project
* This Project can be used by anyone struggling to build a server that sends push notifications to users (both Android and IOS client-users).
* I tried using Onesignal but the package for React-Native Expo doesn't work as its supposed to according to their documentation.
* Currently, with FireBase Cloud Messaging the Expo is still working to provide a support for IOS client (It currently has support for only Android) as at the time of doing this project.

# Key Feature
* Allows push notifications to be sent to users using an interactive GrapQL play ground.
* Expo push notification tokens are stored securely in FireStore.
  
# Tech Stack
* GraphQL.
* Javascript.
* Firebase.
* Firestore.
* Expo-Server.
* GraphQL Playground.
