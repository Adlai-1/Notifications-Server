# About
This Server was created for delivering push notifications for users of the UD-news app ( specifically IOS users ).
This Server was written in JS using Express and GraphQl frameworks.
This Server can also be used to send push notifications to users of mobile as created with React-native Expo.

This Project can be used by anyone struggling to build a server that sends push notifications to users (both Android and IOS client-users).

Personally I tried using Onesignal but the package for React-Native Expo doesn't work as its supposed to according to their documentation.
Currently with FireBase Cloud Messaging the Expo team I believe are still working to provide a support for IOS client (It currently has support for only Android).
